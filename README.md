# Relp
Relp is my first interaction with React Native, it is a service request/solution app that was created in React Native. It has user account creation system, login and a solution system for the Admin to respond.

# Functionality
First you need to create a user, after that you can create a service request. In due time, the Admin will analyze your request and present a solution to it. It's that simple.
